"""Compose streaming and zarr I/O to write one continuous channel.

A channel is the raw samples plus a ladder of level groups above them. Raw is
written first and from the source; each level is folded from the one below,
level 1 from raw. A level group holds one array per statistic over a shared bin
axis: env, mean and valid today.

The fold carries every statistic in one stream of stat blocks and the write
splits that stream into its member arrays, so raw is read once no matter how
many statistics a level holds. An empty input creates the arrays and writes
nothing.
