"""Per-bin event counts: the pyramid a dense event channel carries.

A sparse event channel needs nothing but its own events, which a reader finds by
binary search. A dense one does: a 24-hour, 100-unit sort is a raster of
millions of points at overview zoom, and no viewer draws that. Counting events
into bins and folding the counts by summation gives the same picture in a read
the size of the screen, and the sum fold is exact at every level.

Counts sit on the same 4x ladder as the continuous levels, on the same
onset-relative timeline, but their base period is the producer's to choose
rather than a sample rate. Two things fix it here. The label axis multiplies
everything, so the finest level is sized to a target byte budget given how many
labels the channel has, and the ladder then steps up until a level is smaller
than the screen is wide. That lands the zoom-matched level around a megabyte for
a hundred units over a day, which is the size the format is aiming at.

Counting is streamed rather than accumulated whole. A finest level of a few
million bins across a hundred labels is gigabytes if you hold it, and the events
arrive sorted, so the bins complete in order and can be written as they close.
