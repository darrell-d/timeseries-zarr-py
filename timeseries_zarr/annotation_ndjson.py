"""Read the annotation interchange files the extractors produce.

Every annotation source -- baked into an EDF, a sidecar, a detector run, a
database -- is normalised by its own extractor into one NDJSON file, and the
writer takes NWB plus those files as its inputs. Annotations do not travel
inside NWB because annotations from a database have no NWB home at all, so an
NWB-only path would have needed a second path anyway.

One file is one annotation source and becomes one event channel. A recording
with EDF-baked marks, a detector run and a clinical export produces three files
and three channels.

The first line is the header and every line after it is one mark. Only the
header carries `schema`, which is what lets a truncated or concatenated file be
detected rather than read as data. NDJSON rather than one document because a
detector run is millions of marks, and a document has to be parsed whole before
any of it is usable.

## The timebase

The extractor declares the frame and this reader converts it. That split is
forced by the workflow: the extractor runs in a branch parallel to the signal
conversion, so it cannot read the NWB and cannot know the onset.

- `recording_onset` -- microseconds from the start of the recording.
- `unix_epoch` -- microseconds since 1970.

Both are rebased here onto the absolute timeline the rest of the writer works
in, and the bundle rebases everything once more onto its own onset. Get it
wrong and nothing errors: the marks simply sit at the wrong time, which at
2 kHz nobody sees by eye. It is the highest-risk field in the format.
