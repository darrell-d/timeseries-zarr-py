"""Mapping a timestamped recording onto a uniform sample grid.

A recording with breaks in it carries one timestamp per sample, because a
fixed rate asserts unbroken regularity. The bundle stores no time axis, so the
writer places each sample on the grid position its timestamp names and leaves
the untouched positions NaN.

Nothing here imports NWB or Zarr. Timestamps arrive as any object supporting
``len()`` and slicing to a float64 array, so an in-memory array and an HDF5
dataset both work and neither is read whole.
