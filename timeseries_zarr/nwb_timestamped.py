    An NWB series sampled by timestamps rather than a rate is how a recording

    timestamp names and reports NaN everywhere nothing was recorded, so the
    rest of the writer needs no gap awareness: it sees a channel with a rate
    and a sample count like any other.

    ``num_samples`` is therefore the length of the grid, which exceeds the
