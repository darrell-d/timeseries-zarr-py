"""Write one annotation event channel: marks, and the columns describing them.

A clinician's seizure onset and a detector's forty thousand candidates are the
same shape here. Every column but the timestamps is optional, and a view reads
which ones are present to decide what it can draw, so this writer asks the
source what it has rather than assuming a profile.

Two columns are stored in the Arrow style, a flat array plus an index of n+1
offsets into it: the payloads, and the channels a mark applies to. Both hold a
count per mark that varies from zero upward, which a fixed-width column cannot
carry without sizing every row for the widest one. Sharing the boundary between
neighbours is also what makes a gap or an overlap unrepresentable rather than
merely invalid, and what lets an empty span mean "the whole recording" with no
value reserved to say so.
